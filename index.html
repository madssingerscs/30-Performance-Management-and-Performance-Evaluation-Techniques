                <h3>How can a manager improve performance and Productivity with their Team?</h3>
                <p>
                    To boost productivity, it’s not enough to simply “lead by example”; tools that foster accountability, desire, and competition are essential. Used correctly, these tools can elevate your team’s performance.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Competition:</b> A business owner once created friendly competition between his factory’s day and night shifts by falsely claiming the other shift had set a higher production target. This sparked a rivalry, motivating both shifts to outperform each other. The factory ran two 12-hour shifts—one during the day and one overnight. What opportunities are you missing to introduce friendly competition within your team?</li>
                    <li><b>Deadlines:</b> Parkinson’s Law shows that the more time you give, the less productive people become. Tight deadlines trigger focus and urgency, pushing your team to perform better. When setting deadlines, challenge your team with uncomfortable yet achievable timelines to maximize their focus and output. If you give your team 6 months to complete something, they may procrastinate. However, if you set a deadline for just 6 days, focus intensifies. A deadline that feels tight—but achievable—will drive better results.</li>
                    <li><b>Goals:</b> If no one fails, your goals are too easy. Tim Ferriss suggests aiming for aggressive goals by shortening timelines dramatically. If you can accomplish something in 10 years, ask how it can be done in 5, then 2.5. By pushing your team to achieve the “impossible,” you’ll stretch their abilities and drive innovation. Failure is not bad—what you learn in the process is invaluable.</li>
